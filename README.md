# PI1581 Case 

This project is building on from the great work in the 1541 project. It is under construction. I plan to have a PCB hat included that can be completely assembled by JLCPCB with parts from anywhere.

_NOT READY_

The case includes mounting points for all of the hardware. It is intended to be 3d printed and has been modified from the original to make that easier.
